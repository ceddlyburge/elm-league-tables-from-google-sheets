-- Its annoying that I can't using PlayerId as a key to the Dict
-- and instead have to convert it to a tuple
-- Later players might contain other things, such as cards / penalties
-- Then we will probably store the players in a list in the model,
-- and provide functions to sort that list for the various atributes.
-- For now though, there is only one use case, so store the sorted
-- list.
